# Multiple Positive View
 For Paper in ICLR


There are two ways to re-implement the experiment in Paper.



1. Fast Way

For any kind of paper, Just make sure, they have all same XX. And change multi-View

Just simply adjust the pseudo Code, like 

[Insert Psudeo code here]


For example, We have modified the All benchmark here
https://docs.lightly.ai/self-supervised-learning/getting_started/benchmarks.html#imagenet

Change to our multi-view version.

2. Slow Way
 
We developed a auto pipeline call AutoSSL. bUT We would make it opensource after publishing the paper
All model can be decomposed, so which means the only important thing is Configuration..

1. config
Please check config file.
